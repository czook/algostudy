Certainly! Here's a coding interview question suitable for a Software Engineer 1 position:

**Problem:** 

You are given an array of integers, and your task is to find the maximum product of any two distinct integers from the array.

Write a function `maxProduct` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the maximum product of any two distinct integers from the array. If there are not at least two distinct integers in the array, return None.

**Example:**

```python
maxProduct([2, 3, 4, 5, 6])  # Should return 30 (6 * 5)
maxProduct([1, 2, 3, 4])     # Should return 12 (4 * 3)
maxProduct([1, 1, 2, 2])     # Should return None (There are no distinct integers)
maxProduct([-5, -3, -1, 0, 2]) # Should return 15 (-5 * -3)
```

**Constraints:**

- The input array will have at least two integers.
- The integers in the array can be positive, negative, or zero.
- The array may contain duplicate integers, but you should only consider distinct integers when calculating the maximum product.
