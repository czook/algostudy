# problem 2

We're given a string and need to see if it can be broken down into words from a dictionary array. For example:
JAVASCRIPT

const str = "applecomputer";

const dictArr = ["apple", "computer"];

stringBreakdown(str, dictArr);

// true

Assuming that there are no repeats in the dictionary array, can you write a method that will return true if the string can be broken down into words from the array, or false if not?
Description
Constraints

    Length of the string <= 1000
    The string is made up of ASCII characters (all or some of it)
    Expected time complexity : O(n^2)
    Expected space complexity : O(n)
